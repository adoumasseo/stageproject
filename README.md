Digitization of Material Request and Administrative Leave System
Overview

This project was undertaken as part of an academic internship at the General Directorate of Taxes during my second year at university. The primary goal was to digitize the material request and administrative leave system for the directorate. The project was developed by myself and my partner, focusing on creating a streamlined and efficient front-end solution.
Features

    Administrative Leave System: Enables staff to apply for leave online, with automated workflows for approval and record-keeping.
    User Authentication: Secure login system to ensure only authorized personnel can access the system.
